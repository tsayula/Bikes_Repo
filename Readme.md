**Collaborators**: [Mark Rubin, Lera Tsayukova]

## Overview


This project aims to analyzes the local business needs of the great city of Austin, Texas, whos local slogan "Keep Austin Weird" was inspired by
the cities small business alliance [Austin Indepedent Business Alliance](https://ibuyaustin.com) to promote small businesses!

While Austin is a booming metropolis City, we aim to analyze whether a pizza shop or a taco shop would be more lucrative!

## Method

By analyzing data directly from Yelp's API, we were able to collect a data set of 141 Taco shops and 189 Pizza shops.
Then we sourced a total of nearly 1,000 reviews combined for both taco and pizza shops.
We evaluated this data by using various combinations of the following metrics:
        -total number of businesses for each category 
        -average ratings
        -total number of reviews
        -price point
        

## Data 

-Step 1: Comparing the total number of existing taco shops to pizza shops: 

-Step 2: Analyze the number of taco shops and pizza shops by average rating:

-Step 3: Evaluate the total number of observations for each star rating (1-5) by Category (Pizza, Tacos):

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to 3 conclusions:

- **The market for bike shops in Austin is already saturated.
- **There are at least 5 nieighborhood markets which could benefit from a local pizza shop!
- **There is at least two zipcodes in Austin which lack any small business pizza parlors at all.
- 
### Next Steps

More involved analyses could yield additional insights.
- **Implement Geopandas modeling, use Census data 
- **Acquire financial data in targeted zip codes to help make better predictions
- **Broaden our query to determine the best Retail store or Restaurant Type to open.
