# Comparing 2 Markets

**Collaborators**: [Mark Rubin, Lera Tsayukova]

## Overview


This project aims to analyzes the local business needs of the great city of Austin, Texas, whos local slogan "Keep Austin Weird" was inspired by
the cities small business alliance [Austin Indepedent Business Alliance](https://ibuyaustin.com) to promote small businesses!



While Austin is a booming metropolis City, we aim to analyze whether a pizza shop or a bike shop would be more lucrative!

## Data

The data compares the the number of bikes shops and pizza restaurants by zipcodes and ratings,
in order to determine if there is an opporunity for either.

## Results

-Many pizza shops in Austin are actually franchised by larger chain restaurants!
This leaves a niche market in many neighborhoods for a solid local pizza parlor!

-There is an abundance of bike shopes in Austin.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to 3 conclusions:

- **The market for bike shops in Austin is already saturated.
- **There are at least 5 nieighborhood markets which could benefit from a local pizza shop!
- **There is at least two zipcodes in Austin which lack any small business pizza parlors at all.
- 
### Next Steps

More involved analyses could yield additional insights.
- **Implement Geopandas modeling, use Census data 
- **Acquire financial data in targeted zip codes to help make better predictions
- **Broaden our query to determine the best Retail store or Restaurant Type to open.
